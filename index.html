        <p id="text">This is Kunal Kishor. I am the student of Nitte Meenakashi Intitute of Technalogy. I trying to
            learn
            "Javascript" and "C++" and "DSA with c language"<br>
            &nbsp &nbspNow I am telling all about the Javascript. JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
            language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98%
            of
            websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
            All
            major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>
        <p id="text">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript
            standard.[10] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is
            multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application
            programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
            and
            the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
        <p id="text1">The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or
            graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
            JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers
            and a
            variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.Although Java and
            JavaScript
            are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ
            greatly in design.</p>
